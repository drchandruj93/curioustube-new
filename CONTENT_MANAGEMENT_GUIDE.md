Content: Most productivity advice makes you busier, not more effective. The real secret isn't doing more—it's doing the right things effortlessly.

We're obsessed with optimization. Better tools, better systems, better schedules. But optimization assumes you're already doing the right things. What if you're optimizing the wrong activities?

Once you've eliminated the noise, focus on building systems that work for you, not against you. Design your life so that productivity becomes inevitable.
